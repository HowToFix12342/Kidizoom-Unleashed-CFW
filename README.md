# Kidizoom Unleashed
For the VTech Family of Systems

# What is Kidizoom Unleashed?
Kidizoom Unleashed is a jailbreak developed specifically for devices that may feel too childish for continued use. The mod is designed to breathe new life into these devices.

# Do I need a specific model or version to jailbreak?
Supported Devices: VTech Watch (DX2) or Kidizoom Camera 5.0
Firmware: Watch needs to be on the out-of-the-box firmware (v1.0). No tinkering required for the camera.
Is it out right now?
No, but we've made significant technological advancements that will greatly assist in the development of the jailbreak.

# Can I get my device set up for it now?
Yes, there is a Guide.md file that provides everything you need to get started.

# Is the project open-source?
Not yet, but a GitHub repository will be available well before the official release.

# Are there any apps I need to install?
Yes! While these apps are still in development, you'll eventually need:

App Injector: Injects apps and games onto your system.
CFWInstaller: Installs and updates your custom firmware.

# What’s keeping you from releasing it?
We need more people to help with development! We're looking for help with reverse-engineering apps on the devices to enable custom ones, and it would be great to have a custom boot animation. If you have experience in these areas, we'd love your assistance!

# IMPORTANT: Why Isn't Kidizoom Unleashed Open-Source or Available for Download Yet?
It’s Not Finished Yet: We’re still developing Kidizoom Unleashed. Releasing it too early could cause bugs, instability, or even potential damage to your device. We want to ensure a safe and functional product before sharing it with the community.
Avoiding Piracy: The project currently relies on certain proprietary files to function. Distributing these files without permission would be considered piracy, which is illegal. To prevent this, we are holding off on releasing any downloads until we can create a patch file or script. This will allow users to apply the modifications to their own legitimately obtained firmware, ensuring everything is above board.
